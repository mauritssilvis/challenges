# Challenges

> A collection of programming challenges, solved using different programming languages

## Introduction

With this project, I provide solutions to challenges one commonly encounters when working with different programming languages.

Below, I first describe the [aims](#1-aims) I have with the current project.
I then [list](#2-overview) the programming languages I used to solve programming challenges.

## 1. Aims

My aims with this project are to:

- Extend my knowledge of different programming tools.
- Apply this knowledge in solving practical programming problems.

More generally, I strive to:

- Gain experience with different programming languages.
- Get to know the specifics of these languages.

Finally, I aim to:

- Showcase this experience and knowledge.

## 2. Overview

Currently, solutions to common programming challenges are available in:

- [Java](java)
