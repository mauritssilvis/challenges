## About

With this part of the [Challenges](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/challenges) project, I provide the code and settings for a basic Maven project, set up using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Issues and solutions

While setting up and executing a Maven project, several problems may occur.
I list several of such problems, here, including possible solutions.

### 1. Project object model issues

#### 1.1 The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory

When executing Maven goals, the following error may occur:

```text
[ERROR] The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory. Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory.
```

To solve this problem, ensure the top-level directory of the project contains a Maven project object model file called `pom.xml` and ensure Maven is run in this directory. 

#### 1.2 Non-readable POM: input contained no data

When executing Maven goals, the following error may occur:

```text
[ERROR] Some problems were encountered while processing the POMs:
[FATAL] Non-readable POM: input contained no data
```

To solve this problem, ensure the Maven project object model file, `pom.xml`, contains at least the `project` root element.
This root element can be included without,

```xml
<project></project>
```

or with the optional XML preamble and namespace information,

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
</project>
```

### 2. Maven resources plugin issues

#### 2.1 Using platform encoding (UTF-8 actually) to copy filtered resources, i.e. build is platform dependent!

The Maven resources plugin may throw a warning of the form

```text
[WARNING] Using platform encoding (UTF-8 actually) to copy filtered resources, i.e. build is platform dependent!
```

This warning indicates that no encoding has been set for project files, i.e., sources and resources.
To set the file encoding to UTF-8, include the following line in the `properties` section of the Maven project file, `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    </properties>
</project>
```

### 3. Maven compiler plugin issues

#### 3.1 File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent! 

Similarly, the Maven compiler plugin may return

```text
[WARNING] File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent!
```

This warning indicates that no encoding has been set for project files, i.e., sources and resources.
To set the file encoding to UTF-8, include the following line in the `properties` section in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    </properties>
</project>
```

#### 3.2 Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later. / Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.

The Maven compiler plugin may halt with either of the errors

```text
[ERROR] Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

or

```text
[ERROR] Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

To solve this problem, explicitly set the Java source version in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
For Java 16, either enhance the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the line

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
    </properties>
</project>
```

or configure the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>16</source>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

#### 3.3 Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later. / Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.

The Maven compiler plugin may halt with either of the errors

```text
[ERROR] Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

or

```text
[ERROR] Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

To solve this problem, explicitly set the Java target version in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
For Java 16, either enhance the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the line

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.target>16</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
</project>
```

or configure the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <target>16</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

#### 3.4 Source release 16 requires target release 16

The Maven compiler may encounter the following fatal error while compiling:

```text
source release 16 requires target release 16
```

To solve this problem, ensure that both the Java source and target versions are set in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
Java 16 can be selected by enhancing the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the lines

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>16</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
</project>
```

or by configuring the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>16</source>
                    <target>16</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```
