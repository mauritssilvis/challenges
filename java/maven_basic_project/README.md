## About

With this part of the [Challenges](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/challenges) project, I provide the code and settings for a basic Maven project, set up using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Issues and solutions

While setting up and executing a Maven project, several problems may occur.
I list several of such problems, here, including possible solutions.

### 1. Maven resources plugin issues

#### 1.1 Using platform encoding (UTF-8 actually) to copy filtered resources, i.e. build is platform dependent!

The Maven resources plugin may throw a warning of the form

```text
[WARNING] Using platform encoding (UTF-8 actually) to copy filtered resources, i.e. build is platform dependent!
```

This warning indicates that no encoding has been set for project files, i.e., sources and resources.
To set the file encoding to UTF-8, include the following line in the `properties` section of the Maven project file, `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>
```

### 2. Maven compiler plugin issues

#### 2.1 File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent! 

Similarly, the Maven compiler plugin may return

```text
[WARNING] File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent!
```

This warning indicates that no encoding has been set for project files, i.e., sources and resources.
To set the file encoding to UTF-8, include the following line in the `properties` section in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>
```

#### 2.2 Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later. / Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.

The Maven compiler plugin may halt with either of the errors

```text
[ERROR] Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

or

```text
[ERROR] Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

To solve this problem, explicitly set the Java source version in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
For Java 16, either enhance the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the line

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
</properties>
```

or configure the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <source>16</source>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 2.3 Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later. / Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.

The Maven compiler plugin may halt with either of the errors

```text
[ERROR] Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

or

```text
[ERROR] Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
```

To solve this problem, explicitly set the Java target version in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
For Java 16, either enhance the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the line

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.target>16</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

or configure the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <target>16</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### 2.4 Source release 16 requires target release 16

The Maven compiler may encounter the following fatal error while compiling:

```text
source release 16 requires target release 16
```

To solve this problem, ensure that both the Java source and target versions are set in the Maven project file, `pom.xml`.
Java 16 can be selected by enhancing the `properties` section of `pom.xml` with the lines

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>16</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

or by configuring the Maven compiler in the `build` section:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <source>16</source>
                <target>16</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```
