# Challenges > Java

> A collection of programming challenges, solved using Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Challenges](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/challenges) project, I provide solutions to common programming challenges in Java.

Under [Status](#1-status), I give an overview of the challenges that I solved using Java so far.
I also provide some [background information](#2-background) on [Java](#21-java) and the tools I used, namely, [IntelliJ IDEA](#22-intellij-idea) and [Maven](#23-maven).

## 1. Status

Currently, Java solutions are available to challenges in the categories shown below.
Note that I solved all these challenges using [IntelliJ IDEA](#22-intellij-idea).

### Maven

#### Projects

* [Setting up a basic Maven project using IntelliJ IDEA](basic_maven_project_intellij)

#### JARs

* [Creating an executable JAR using Maven](executable_jar_maven_intellij)

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Java

### 2.2 IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
This IDE supports Java, several other Java virtual machine (JVM) languages and can be extended with plugins to retrieve support for other programming languages.
IntelliJ IDEA comes with a [detailed online documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea.html) and its [community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) can be downloaded and used for free.

IntelliJ IDEA makes it easy to configure code styles, automatic copyright notices, code inspection profiles, run configurations and more.
An overview of the configurations used in the above-mentioned projects is provided in the [IntelliJ IDEA section](basic_maven_project_intellij#13-intellij-idea) of [Setting up a basic Maven project using IntelliJ IDEA](basic_maven_project_intellij).


### 2.3 Maven
